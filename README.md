# rag-physics-chatbot
I started this project on April 10, 2025 and finished it on May 17, 2025. I might add more improvements in the future.
My system specs: ASUS F15 GAMING LAPTOP
RTX 4050 6 GB VRAM, i7-13700H, 16 GB RAM

# Model
I harnessed the power of the Mistral 7B LLM for this project specifically: "mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf" from "https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF".

# Dataset:
I have created this RAG physics chatbot using this dataset: arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json, which I got from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv".
This dataset has over a million research papers related to physics, mathematics etc. I then filtered the irrelevant categories and only used the physics papers.
